# What I enjoyed reading
**I still don't know how I'm going to organize all that once it grows. But I'll just drop the last stuff I enjoyed reading.**

## [Yossi Kreinin](yosefk.com/blog/)
I love his reflections about unintended consequences and basic human psychology applied to our field. Two of my favorites articles are:
- [Advantages of incompetent management](https://yosefk.com/blog/advantages-of-incompetent-management.html) - Sometimes, it's better when your managers don't know what they are doing.
- [Love thy coworker; thy work, not necessarily](https://yosefk.com/blog/love-thy-coworker-thy-work-not-necessarily.html) - I won't do the offence of poorly summarizing that one, but it's about how valuable intrinsic motivation is overestimated at the office.

## [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/)
Three of my favorites articles:
- [Futurist prediction methods and accuracy](danluu.com/futurist-predictions/) - The title says it all, I'll add this one is really complete.
- [Misidentifying talent](danluu.com/talent/) - About bias in skill assessment.
- [Willingness to look stupid](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/) - `Although there are some downsides to people thinking that I'm stupid, e.g., failing interviews where the interviewer very clearly thought I was stupid, I think that, overall, the upsides of being willing to look stupid have greatly outweighed the downsides.`
