# Competency Cycle
There is this pattern in tech that I ended up noticing.  
A new tech or methodology appears and solves a real problem.  
People that created it and people that specifically need it are quite close actually.  
Maybe at the same org, or at least part of the same ecosystem.  
That new tech comes from bright minds, it's shiny, it's trending.  
Highly motivated people that follow those latest trends pick it up and do something with it.  
Using it is becomes a marker of skill.  
Maybe people actually don't need it to solve their problems.  
But they use it anyway, since they learned how to.  
And less and less motivated people end up joining that trend.  
Not necessarily because they perceive the value in it.  
Mostly because it helps them belong in the group of people that deserve to be paid more.

It happened many times and will happen again.  
It may happen years appart, for the same tech or methodology,
in different countries or even cities, or even accross different industries.  

And sometimes, the trend has to go in the opposite direction at some point.  
Maybe even just to flee the people who pretend to care and are actually making everything so terrible.  

I may or may not have been talking about:
- Microservices, then wanting to go back to a monolithic architecture.
  - Maybe at first it helped to force people to split their logic,
    but then some people started splitting it in the most absurd way.
  - Maybe they even end-up with each microservice being far more bloated than one unic monolith should be.
  - Maybe it will be even worse when they go back to that so glorious monolith
    after reading I don't know what blog post.
- SPA, then going back to SSR.
  - Maybe if you think HTMX is the best
    because it's the solution to most of the problems that most of the frontend developers encounter today,
    you fail to understand what caused those issues.
  - And I can assure you, the overall HTMX experience could be terrible too, although not for the same reasons.
  - Maybe you just don't have to ship an 8MB bundle when you know what you are doing.
- Redis, Mongo, Celery... Instead of a relational database with a well thought data model.
  - Some people had to diverge from the established relational database principles for good reasons.
  - Many people think they can't do with just a Postgres database. [Most of them actually could.](https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/).
    - Not that you should. That was the only link I provided, because it's an interesting take, it might get traction.
    - I don't want to be guilty of my own accusations, so while I'd recommend you to experiment with those,
      I have to say that submiting to the zeitgeist of your current environment might be the smartest choice.
    - I won't go into details because there are so many of them,
      but Postgres forks that solve the scalability problem are proabably (one of) the next big thing though.
- Any methodology like Clean Code, Scrum, Extreme programming,
  I don't even want to have a discussion about those anymore.

Actually, all of those techs and methodologies are decent choices when picked and applied wisely.

Maybe the problem is people who think that something is utterly good or bad.  
And not that it depends on the context most of the time.  
But maybe they are right in a way, as they found their safe space,
and they don't have to care about where the rules are different.  
Maybe the problem is people who want to oversell or overblame in their personal interest,
sometimes not even consciously.  
Maybe the problem is people who pretend to care and actually don't, they just want to belong.  
That one is usually a pretty good root cause.
