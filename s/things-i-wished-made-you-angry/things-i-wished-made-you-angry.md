just an outline, committing this though

# Things I wished made you angry

It's weird to write this in the way I write this article, but I thought a lot about how I handle negativity. I also though about how useless negative writing actually is. Do you want the sponge inside your skull to fill with doomer content? Won't you be able to keep going, and actually live a more fullilling life by microdosing these little doses of wholesomeness through memes and heartwarming stories?

Overall, there are a lot of good things happening, and the news complex (todo rephrase) makes a profit from our caveman instinct that needs to feel like it's getting the information on what is going wrong with the world.

I'm angry at this, but I'm even angrier that the things that should actually make most people angry, (as, in the long term, have quite a real negative effect on their lives), aren't actually making them angry.

As these things don't have a direct effect, it's really hard to raise awareness. And I don't know these things could change in the long term, without actually trying to raise awareness somehow.

But maybe, infodumping about these issues may somehow be useful? Let's just list a few of these things, and see if a pattern emerges?


## Petrol using individualism

## Green party

## Nuclear market


## And so, should we just be angry?
First of all, do you see a pattern emerging? Well, these things actually have a huge negative impact on the state of the world. And these things don't really have culprits easy to pinpoint.
