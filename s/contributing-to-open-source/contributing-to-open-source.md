# Some advices on how to contribute to Open Source
Some friend asked me for advice on how to start contributing to Open Source projects. This is what I'd tell him right now, non-formal, and I'll make this into a real article later :)

- **Start small.** May sound harsh but I have to keep telling this to myself. Complexity is exponential, you'll always end up going down the rabbit hole. Do the easiest thing that brings some value, then do harder and harder things. It's really hard to commit enough time outside of paid work if you already have so many side-projects.
- **If possible, go for projects that bring yourself value / that you actually use.** This is far easier when you already have a good overview of the project, and even some instinct of how things may work under the hood. Actually fixing some weird behaviour of that experimental lib you used at work may be a really good starting point.
- **Go for issues that have a specific label, like `help wanted` or - even better - `good first issue`.** e.g. [this issue was perfect to drop some small PRs](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja/issues/664).
- **Write some documentation.** You don't have to master the whole project. Most of the time, the documentation comes last, and this is a huge help you can offer the main contributors, for the smallest amount of your time.
- **Find a project with a positive impact through a specific platform.** Personally, I'd rather contribute to the frameworks and libs that those projects would use, but you can check [ForGoodFirstIssue](https://forgoodfirstissue.github.com/) for projects with a positive impact that need some help, some specific issues are specifically linked, for some projects you have to check the issue tracker of the project itself. There are many other of these platforms, like [good first issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/).

This one is for me actually, but I should talk less about code, and write more of it I guess
