# Puzzles
Just some puzzles I enjoyed, you may also check [my coding puzzles recommendations and solutions](https://github.com/c4ffein/puzzles).

## Books
### [How Would You Move Mount Fuji?](https://www.amazon.fr/How-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji/dp/0316778494)
A book about Microsoft's cult of the puzzle, both a good criticism and a good source for the puzzles they ask to each others and to interviewees.

## Accessible from the web
### [Sedecordle](https://www.sedecordle.com/)
There is still a point playing a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)-like when you're filling 16 words in 21 tries.

### [Jane Street Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/)
You can go for the [current one](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/) or just browse [the archive](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/index.html).

### [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/)
[Simon Tatham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Tatham)'s own [puzzle collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/), accessible from your browser.

## Games
### [Braid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/499180/Braid_Anniversary_Edition/)
Imo, the masterpiece, seems like a nice little platformer with nice graphics and nice music (the [Anniversary Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/499180/Braid_Anniversary_Edition/) has to be played on a 4K screen), but there are clever puzzles and it conveys real meaning, if you care. May start too easy (some of the greatest mind of our time may even consider this is [for people who smoke, or people who drink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSXofLK5hFQ) without going past the first levels) but it does build further with some new mechanics.
And the [Anniversary Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/499180/Braid_Anniversary_Edition/) does come with commentaries to convince you that yes, this is a masterpiece.

### [The Talos Principle 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/835960/The_Talos_Principle_2/)
First person, lasers, colored lasers, tools that do stuff with lasers, teleporters, bumpers...
Very well made, not really hard, I'd really recommend and I still hope for a harder DLC - update, the DLC is really good.
They introduced many game mechanics but didn't mix them as much as they could
(that's what the DLC for the first one did, no new mechanic, but instead built far more complex puzzles with what was already introduced).

The philosophy in this game is cheap, there is nothing you'll find in it that you can't come up with by yourself.
And the NPCs won't stop talking.
But at least [they're making young engineers think about AI and consciousness](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hgpGbepiNzHMBDHcF/the-talos-principle).

Thanks to [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/developer-interviews/inside-croteam-s-transition-from-in-house-tech-to-ue5-for-the-talos-principle-2), it's really beautiful for a 3D puzzle game with that artistic direction, you can't compare with [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) (still aesthetically pleasant imo, but it's not like it could compete with a AAA).

### [Portal 2](store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/)
First person, portals and momentum, dialogues you may find funny, not that hard but you may enjoy the vibe.

### [We Were Here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/582500/We_Were_Here/)
A first person 2 player escape game in which  you have to share information with your pair (away in other rooms) to escape. The [first one](https://store.steampowered.com/app/582500/We_Were_Here/) is really easy (and free), not even really a puzzle game, but still good to introduce you and your pair to the information sharing that is required for all of those. They become better and better.

### [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/)
A [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) where you can move words to make new rules. As always, start simple, finish hard.
