  Or is it consistent for a project in this current state?

● Let me check what's taking up space:

● [ bash command to find the files ]

● The blobs are still there under [ old paths ] - there was a rename at some point!
  We only filtered the new paths.

● [ starts trying stuff, didn't work, I had to nudge though ]
