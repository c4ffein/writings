# writings

I wanted to write for many years, but creating my own blog wasn't my top priority,
as I knew I would spend so many hours on it, already having so many ideas on how to design it.
Perfectionism really is a flaw, I should have found somewhere to write in the meantime.

After reading [this](https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md),
I came to the conclusion that GitHub might just be the perfect platform. I should focus on what matters first.

So, I'll just see how this repo ends-up in the long term.  
Actually, the more I think about it, the more I consider the history provided by git to be a really nice feature for whoever actually cares to read this.

Feel free to drop an issue if you want to start a discussion (even just to correct my english, I'm a non-native speaker, and even that would be appreciated).
