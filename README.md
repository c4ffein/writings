# writings

I wanted to write for many years, but creating my own blog wasn't my top priority,
as I knew I would spend so many hours on it, already having so many ideas on how to design it.
Perfectionism really is a flaw, I should have found somewhere to write in the meantime.

After reading [this](https://github.com/unclebob/cmuratori-discussion/blob/main/cleancodeqa.md),
I came to the conclusion that GitHub might just be the perfect platform. I should focus on what matters first.

So, I'll see how this repo ends-up in the long term, but I'll just start with this: [Competency Cycle](competency_cycle/competency_cycle.md)

Feel free to drop an issue if you want to start a discussion.
